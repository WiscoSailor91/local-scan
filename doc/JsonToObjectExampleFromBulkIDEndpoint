Object containing
  field named "characters", which is *either* (Jackson-wise) an array of or List<> of:
    Object
      containing an int field called "id"
      containing a String field called "name"

If we wanted this automagically mapped back from an HTTP request, we'd create a
data transfer object (DTO) like:

------

data comes in (JSON) with some array of names (String)
  - check that they're not bullshit weird symbols/letters/not-allowed-eve-names
  - look in the DB to see if they're there, and if not add them (we'll look up ID numbers later)

EVE rules (https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/8563435867804-EVE-Online-Naming-Policy):
- 3 to 37 characters, consisting of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-" (minus, not en-dash), and single quote "'"
  - first-and-optional-middle name, optionally followed by family name
- "name" (first and optional middle name) limited to 24 characters with optional space iff middle name
- "family name", optional, limited to 12 characters
- space, minus, and single-quote may not be the first or last character
- corporation names may include the "." (period) character
